# 4 — Run and operate the server

This guide starts from a built distribution (`target/dist/j-redis-1.0.0/`, see
[guide 3 §3.5](03-build-and-test.md#35-package-the-distribution)). Paths such
as `bin/…` are relative to that directory. The reference tables for every
configuration directive, `INFO` field and runbook entry are in
[../11-operations-and-security.md](../11-operations-and-security.md).

## 4.1 Quick start

```bash
# Linux
bin/j-redis-server conf/j-redis-dev.conf
```

```bat
rem Windows
bin\j-redis-server.cmd conf\j-redis-dev.conf
```

The server logs `j-redis 1.0.0 ready (0 keys)` and listens on `127.0.0.1:6379`.
In a second terminal:

```bash
bin/j-redis-cli ping                 # PONG
bin/j-redis-cli set hello world      # OK
bin/j-redis-cli get hello            # "world"
bin/j-redis-examples -p 6379         # the client examples, against this server
```

**Stopping.** Press Ctrl+C in the server's terminal, or send `SIGTERM`
(`kill <pid>`, `systemctl stop`). Both run the clean shutdown: stop accepting
clients, finish the AOF, fsync, exit. On Linux the exit status is then 143
(128 + SIGTERM), which is normal for Java. The `SHUTDOWN` command also works
unless it is disabled (as it is in the production config).

**Without the distribution**, the jar runs on its own:

```bash
java -Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:+UseG1GC -jar j-redis-server-1.0.0-all.jar --port 6379 --dir ./data
```

## 4.2 Configuration

A text file, one `directive value` per line, `#` for comments, in the same
style as Redis. Pass it as the first argument. Any directive can also be given
on the command line as `--directive value`, which overrides the file:

```bash
bin/j-redis-server conf/j-redis.conf --port 6380 --dir /tmp/j-redis-test
```

The directives you will touch most:

| Directive | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `6379` | TCP port (`0` = any free port, reported in `INFO server`) |
| `bind` | `127.0.0.1` | Addresses to listen on (several allowed) |
| `requirepass` | *(none)* | Password clients must send with `AUTH` |
| `dir` | `./data` | Data directory |
| `appendonly` | `yes` | Persistence on/off (`no`: memory only, lost on stop) |
| `appendfsync` | `everysec` | `everysec`: fsync periodically; `no`: leave it to the OS |
| `appendfsync-interval-millis` | `1000` | The fsync period for `everysec`, 10–60000 ms. It bounds data loss on a power failure. |
| `maxmemory` | `0` (unlimited) | Data size limit (estimate); writes fail with `-OOM` above it |
| `maxclients` | `1000` | Connection limit |
| `timeout` | `0` | Close idle clients after N seconds (`0` = never) |
| `disable-command` | *(none)* | Repeatable; the command then looks unknown to clients. A misspelled name stops start-up with an error. |
| `enable-debug-command` | `no` | Enables `DEBUG SLEEP/RELOAD/SET-ACTIVE-EXPIRE` (development only) |

Sizes accept `k`/`m`/`g` (×1000) and `kb`/`mb`/`gb` (×1024): `maxmemory 3gb`.
The full list is in [../11 §2](../11-operations-and-security.md#2-configuration).

**At runtime.** `CONFIG GET <pattern>` reads settings, and `CONFIG SET <name>
<value> [<name> <value> …]` changes those marked *yes* in the full list, all or
nothing. Such changes last until the next restart: they are **not** written
back to the file, so edit the file too.

```bash
bin/j-redis-cli config get 'maxmem*'
bin/j-redis-cli config set slowlog-log-slower-than 5000
```

**Logging** goes to standard output. The level comes from the environment
variable `JREDIS_LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`). For a different format or a log
file, pass your own Logback file:
`JREDIS_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1g -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/j-redis/logback.xml"`.
Command arguments are never logged at INFO or above, because they may contain
secrets.

## 4.3 Security checklist

- Keep `bind 127.0.0.1` unless clients run on other hosts. With no password,
  *protected mode* refuses non-loopback clients anyway (`-DENIED`).
- Set `requirepass` to a long random value (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Keep it in
  the config file with mode `600`, never on the command line, where `ps` shows
  it.
- Disable what production does not need: `disable-command FLUSHALL`,
  `FLUSHDB`, `KEYS`, `SHUTDOWN` (as in `conf/j-redis.conf`). `DEBUG` is off
  unless `enable-debug-command yes`.
- Traffic is not encrypted. That is fine on one host or a private network, but
  not across untrusted networks.

## 4.4 Production on Linux (systemd)

```bash
# 1. a user and the program
sudo useradd --system --home /var/lib/j-redis --shell /usr/sbin/nologin jredis
sudo tar -xzf j-redis-1.0.0.tar.gz -C /opt
sudo ln -sfn /opt/j-redis-1.0.0 /opt/j-redis          # upgrades swap this link (guide 7)

# 2. the configuration (set requirepass!)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/j-redis
sudo cp /opt/j-redis/conf/j-redis.conf /etc/j-redis/j-redis.conf
sudo chown root:jredis /etc/j-redis/j-redis.conf && sudo chmod 640 /etc/j-redis/j-redis.conf
sudo editor /etc/j-redis/j-redis.conf

# 3. the service (edit the java path in ExecStart if your JDK is elsewhere)
sudo cp /opt/j-redis/systemd/j-redis.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now j-redis

# 4. check
systemctl status j-redis
journalctl -u j-redis -f                                # the log
/opt/j-redis/bin/j-redis-cli -a "$SECRET" info server
```

The unit creates `/var/lib/j-redis` (data) and `/var/log/j-redis` (GC log,
heap dumps), restarts the server after a fail-stop (exit 4), and deliberately
does **not** restart after exit 1, 2 or 3, which need a human
([§4.11](#411-troubleshooting)).

**Heap size.** The unit sets `-Xms8g -Xmx8g` with `maxmemory 3gb`. The data
estimate should stay below about 40 % of the heap, because the snapshot's
copies and garbage collection need headroom. For other sizes, keep that ratio
([../06 §6](../06-expiry-and-memory.md#6-jvm-heap-sizing)).

## 4.5 Windows (development)

Production is Linux. On Windows, run the server in a console with
`bin\j-redis-server.cmd conf\j-redis-dev.conf` and stop it with **Ctrl+C**.
Closing the window instead gives the JVM only a few seconds to shut down. JVM
options go in `JREDIS_JAVA_OPTS`:

```bat
set JREDIS_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+UseG1GC
bin\j-redis-server.cmd conf\j-redis-dev.conf --port 6380
```

The data directory (`data` in the dev config) is relative to the current
directory. Directory fsync does not exist on Windows and is skipped; nothing
else differs.

## 4.6 The command-line client

```bash
bin/j-redis-cli                                  # interactive, 127.0.0.1:6379
bin/j-redis-cli -h 10.0.0.5 -p 6380 -a secret    # another server, with a password
bin/j-redis-cli incr visits                      # one command; exit code 1 if it returns an error
bin/j-redis-cli --raw lrange q:jobs 0 -1         # plain values, one per line (for scripts)
bin/j-redis-cli --scan --pattern 'sess:*'        # list keys safely with SCAN
bin/j-redis-cli --bigkeys                        # the largest key of each type
bin/j-redis-cli --latency                        # continuous PING round trips (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

Interactive mode takes redis-cli syntax, with quotes for spaces
(`set greeting "hello world"`). `MULTI`/`EXEC`, `WATCH`, `BLPOP` and
`SUBSCRIBE` all work there. Replies look like this:

```
127.0.0.1:6379> zadd lb 10 alice 20 bob
(integer) 2
127.0.0.1:6379> zrevrange lb 0 -1 withscores
1) "bob"
2) "20"
3) "alice"
4) "10"
```

Handy administration commands:

| Command | Shows or does |
|---|---|
| `INFO [section]` | server, clients, memory, persistence, stats, commandstats, cpu, keyspace |
| `DBSIZE` | number of keys |
| `CLIENT LIST` / `CLIENT KILL ID <id>` | connected clients / disconnect one |
| `SLOWLOG GET 10` / `SLOWLOG RESET` | the slowest recent commands |
| `CONFIG GET *` | every setting |
| `BGREWRITEAOF` | compact the AOF now (runs in the background) |
| `LASTSAVE` | time of the last completed rewrite |

## 4.7 Persistence in practice

The data directory holds:

```
manifest          which files make up the data (text, human-readable)
base.N.jrdb       a snapshot of all keys at one moment (binary, CRC-protected)
incr.N.aof        every change since that snapshot, as RESP commands (text-like)
LOCK              held while a server uses the directory
```

- Every write is appended to the current `incr` file and fsynced every
  `appendfsync-interval-millis`. A **power failure** can lose about that much.
  A **process crash** (`kill -9`) can lose the last few milliseconds of
  acknowledged writes. A **clean stop** loses nothing.
- When the incr files grow to twice the base size (and at least 64 MB), a
  **rewrite** writes a new base in the background, without `fork()` and
  without pausing clients (except very briefly for very large keys,
  [../08 §6](../08-persistence.md#6-the-big-key-caveat)). `BGREWRITEAOF` starts
  one by hand.
- Start-up loads the base and replays the incr files. A torn last record, left
  by a crash in the middle of a write, is cut off with a warning.

## 4.8 Backup and restore

A consistent backup of a **running** server:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# backup-j-redis.sh <backup-dir>   (run as a user that can read /var/lib/j-redis)
set -eu
CLI="/opt/j-redis/bin/j-redis-cli -a $SECRET"
DEST="$1/j-redis-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
OLD=$($CLI --raw config get auto-aof-rewrite-percentage | tail -1)
$CLI config set auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 0          # no rewrite may delete files during the copy
trap '$CLI config set auto-aof-rewrite-percentage "$OLD"' EXIT
mkdir -p "$DEST"
cp /var/lib/j-redis/manifest "$DEST/"                   # the manifest FIRST
for f in $(awk '$1=="base"||$1=="incr"{print $2}' /var/lib/j-redis/manifest); do
    cp "/var/lib/j-redis/$f" "$DEST/"
done
echo "backup in $DEST"
```

Copying the manifest first and blocking rewrites makes the copy consistent. An
incr file copied while it is being appended to just has a torn tail, which
loading tolerates.

**Restore:** stop the server, replace the contents of the data directory with
the backup, and start it. Check a backup (or any data directory) offline with
`bin/j-redis-tools check-aof <dir>`.

## 4.9 Monitoring

Poll `INFO` (for example every 10 s) and alert on:

| Condition | Why |
|---|---|
| `used_memory` > 80 % of `maxmemory` | Writes will start failing with `-OOM` |
| `aof_last_write_status` ≠ `ok`, or `aof_last_fsync_age_ms` > 5000 | Disk problem; writes fail with `-MISCONF` |
| `internal_errors` increasing | A bug; see the log |
| `commandstats` p99 above 1 ms for fast commands | Latency problem (`SLOWLOG`, big keys, GC) |
| `connected_clients` > 80 % of `maxclients` | Connection leak in a client |
| `aof_rewrite_longest_record_ms` growing | A key is getting too big |

The client library has its own counters and latency histograms
(`client.metrics()`, [guide 5 §5.13](05-client-guide.md#513-configuration-and-metrics)).

## 4.10 The tools

```bash
# load test (see the notes below)
bin/j-redis-tools benchmark -c 50 -n 100000 -t set,get
bin/j-redis-tools benchmark -c 50 -n 1000000 -P 16 -r 100000 -t zadd,zincrby,zrevrank,zaround -q

# data files (server stopped)
bin/j-redis-tools check-aof /var/lib/j-redis           # exit 0 = healthy
bin/j-redis-tools check-aof /var/lib/j-redis --fix     # cut a torn tail of the last incr file
bin/j-redis-tools dump /var/lib/j-redis | head         # one line per key in the base file
bin/j-redis-tools dump --values --max-elements 5 /var/lib/j-redis/base.3.jrdb
```

Benchmark options: `-c` connections, `-n` requests per test, `-P` requests in
flight per connection (pipelining), `-d` value size, `-r` random key space
(`0` = one key), `-t` tests, `-q` one line per test. Measure on the production
machine with nothing else running: on a shared or busy machine, thread
wake-ups dominate and the numbers mean little.

## 4.11 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Exit 1, `Address already in use` | Something else listens on the port | Stop it, or use `--port` |
| Exit 1, `configuration error: …` | Invalid directive or value | The message names the line |
| Exit 2, `data directory … is in use` | Another server uses the same `dir` | Stop it, or use another `dir` |
| Exit 3, `cannot load data: …` | A corrupt data file | `bin/j-redis-tools check-aof <dir>`; see the runbook in [../11 §8](../11-operations-and-security.md#8-runbook) |
| Exit 4 | Fail-stop after an internal error | systemd restarts it; the log names the command. Report it as a bug. |
| Clients get `-DENIED …protected mode` | A non-loopback client and no password | Set `requirepass` (and `bind` to the right address) |
| Clients get `-NOAUTH` | The password is required but was not sent | Set `password(...)` in the client builder, or `-a` in the CLI |
| Clients get `-OOM command not allowed…` | `maxmemory` reached | `INFO memory`, `--bigkeys`, keys without TTL |
| Clients get `-MISCONF …` | The AOF cannot be written (disk full?) | Free disk space; it recovers by itself |
| `-ERR max number of clients reached` | `maxclients` reached | Look for a client that leaks connections (`CLIENT LIST`) |
